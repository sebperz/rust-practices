# What did i practice?:
- Practice fn creation, and ways to return them
- .trim() and .parse()
- Some recursive practice
- Some boolean operations
- Rust Lambda Functions
- mach

# What could be improve or make diferent:
## Improve:

## Make different:
- Make a turn sistem, that way i dont have to count hard code Turn X and O
- The way i compare values to know if theres a winner, some other options: bitwise operation (Johan did it this way), Prime multiplication number, or even Magic Square Sum (up to 15)
- The coloring

# Cheat Sheat:

THING.paser()::<DATA_VALUE> , if DATA_VALUE != u32, is the Default

let LAMBDA_FUNCTION = |NAME_OF_VALUE: TYPE_OF_VALUE|

format!("{}",NAME_OF_VALUE) , return a String
